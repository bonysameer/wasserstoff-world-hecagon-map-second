Steps to Run/Build the Project
_________________________________


1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Node.js installed.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies.
5. Once the installation is complete, run npm start to start the development server.
6. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the project.

   ## Project Approach

In this project, I have utilized React.js and various supporting libraries such as React Router DOM, useEffect, and BrowserRouter to create a web application named "Wasserstoff". The application implements client-side routing to provide a smooth and seamless user experience.

To tackle the project requirements, I have structured the application using functional components and employed React's useEffect hook for performing side effects and managing the component lifecycle. The React Router DOM library is utilized for handling navigation and rendering different components based on the routes.

Throughout the development process, I have followed best practices and maintained a clean and organized code structure. The project showcases my proficiency in working with React.js and related technologies, as well as my ability to implement client-side routing efficiently.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
